Terminator is a free, open-source, terminal emulator with some extra
features, including support for plugins.  Terminator is the work of
Chris Jones, Stephen Boddy, et al.  It is coded in Python v2, and is
likely available in your distribution's repositories, or if not, in
a third-party repo.   Here is a link to the Terminator project on
Launchpad:   https://launchpad.net/terminator

These plugins are also free and open-source.  To install them you
must first have installed Terminator and it's dependencies.  Then
you can simply drop the three *.py files into Terminator's plugins
directory, which can be found by typing 'sudo updatedb', then
'locate terminatorlib/plugins'.  You will need elavated privileges
to do so.  Permissions on the files may include executable
permission, but it is not necessary.

Finally, open a Terminator window, go to Preferences->Plugins, and
enable 'BackgroundZoom' and 'AppearanceEditor'.
